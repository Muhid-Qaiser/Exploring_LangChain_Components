From natural language processing to computer vision and multimodal systems, the Transformer has become foundational to advancements across these fields.  \\nBut what exactly makes the Transformer so powerful? Why does it excel where previous models struggled, and what unique challenges does it address? This article will dive into these questions, exploring the innovations behind the Transformer and why it’s such a game-changer.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'What is the Transformer?'}, page_content='The Transformer model, introduced in the influential 2017 paper “Attention is All You Need” by Vaswani et al., was originally designed for machine translation. However, its flexible, robust architecture has since revolutionized modern AI, especially in tasks involving sequential data like text and images. The Transformer overcame the limitations of earlier models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), by leveraging a powerful mechanism called “self-attention” that allows it to capture relationships across long sequences efficiently and effectively.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Limitations of RNN and LSTMs:'}, page_content='Before the transformer model was invented, sequence transduction models dominated the industry when it came to tasks that involved sequence such as machine translation. These models are usually based on complex RNN or LSTM that include an encoder and a decoder. The encoder would encode the given text into an encoded vector and the decoder would decode the encoded vector in the other language. These models had a great drawback, there were sequential and were computationally very expensive.  \\n1. Vanishing/Exploding Gradients  \\nTechnical Explanation: RNNs rely on backpropagation through time (BPTT) to update weights based on error gradients propagated through each time step. In practice, this approach causes gradients to diminish (vanish) or amplify (explode) as they move across long sequences, especially with deeper networks. This is due to repetitive multiplications of derivatives in each time step. In simple terms, the gradients become too small to make meaningful updates (vanishing), or too large, causing instability (exploding).  \\nLSTMs use gating mechanisms to control the flow of information and partially address vanishing gradients by allowing information to “skip” certain steps. However, they don’t completely solve the issue for very long sequences, as even LSTMs are still susceptible to vanishing gradients over very long contexts.  \\nPractical Example: In language modeling, consider a sentence: “The cat sat on the __.” A basic RNN will struggle to retain information about “cat” if there’s a long sequence of words between it and the blank. Due to vanishing gradients, the RNN essentially “forgets” the earlier part of the sequence, causing the model to fail in predicting contextually relevant words. LSTMs partially address this with gates (input, output, and forget gates) that help regulate the flow of information over time steps. However, with longer texts or sequences, even LSTMs still face limitations.  \\n2. Sequential Processing and Slow Training  \\nTechnical Explanation: RNNs and LSTMs process input data step-by-step. Each step depends on the computation of the previous one, which makes parallel processing difficult. This dependency results in longer training times and higher computational costs, especially when working with long sequences. Although models like bidirectional LSTMs allow processing in two directions, they don’t achieve full parallelism.  \\nPractical Example: In real-time speech recognition, where long audio sequences need to be processed quickly, RNNs and LSTMs take longer to train and produce output due to their sequential nature. Processing lengthy audio or video data also becomes inefficient, as each time step must complete before the next one can begin.  \\n3. Limited Memory for Long-Term Dependencies  \\nTechnical Explanation: Even with memory cells, LSTMs tend to “forget” information over long sequences. The gates in LSTMs only partially help in retaining relevant information but still prioritize more recent data over distant dependencies. Consequently, when models require deep context — such as understanding references in lengthy documents — RNNs and LSTMs struggle to retain and leverage information from earlier parts of the sequence.  \\nPractical Example: In machine translation, translating a long paragraph from one language to another often requires the model to remember information from the beginning of the paragraph to accurately translate later sentences. With RNNs or LSTMs, the translation quality diminishes as the model loses track of earlier parts, which is especially problematic for languages with complex sentence structures or that place crucial information at the start of sentences.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'How Transformers Address These Limitations'}, page_content='1. Self-Attention Mechanism  \\nTechnical Explanation: The Transformer architecture replaces the sequential processing of RNNs with self-attention, which calculates the importance of each word or token relative to every other token in the sequence. Self-attention computes three vectors for each token: the query, key, and value vectors. For each token, the query vector is compared to every key vector, producing attention scores that determine how much focus to place on each other token. This approach enables each token to draw relevant contextual information from across the sequence, regardless of its position, effectively “remembering” long-range dependencies.  \\nPractical Example: In a sentence like “The scientist who won the Nobel Prize in 2019 was born in a small town,” self-attention allows the model to capture relationships across the sentence. Even if “scientist” and “small town” are far apart, the model can connect them by attending to all relevant parts of the sentence simultaneously, which RNNs would struggle to do.  \\n2. Parallelization and Faster Training  \\nTechnical Explanation: Unlike RNNs, which must process sequences step-by-step, the Transformer processes each token position independently by applying self-attention across the entire sequence at once. This parallelism enables Transformers to make full use of modern hardware, significantly accelerating training. Transformers also add positional encodings to the input data, which allows the model to retain information about the sequence order even when processing positions in parallel.  \\nPractical Example: In large-scale language modeling, such as training GPT-3, which has billions of parameters, parallel processing across thousands of tokens at once drastically reduces training time. Each word can be processed at the same time as all others, allowing models like BERT or GPT to be trained on massive datasets, spanning books and websites, in a reasonable amount of time. Training a similar-scale RNN would be practically infeasible due to slow sequential processing.  \\n3. Scalability and Capacity for Long-Range Dependencies  \\nTechnical Explanation: The Transformer’s multi-head self-attention extends its capacity to handle and process multiple dependencies across varying parts of the sequence. Multiple attention heads allow it to look at different parts of a sequence simultaneously and capture nuanced dependencies that might be overlooked if only one perspective was used. This makes Transformers highly effective at capturing complex relationships and long-term dependencies within long sequences.  \\nPractical Example: In document summarization, Transformers excel at identifying key points throughout an entire document without losing track of important details at the beginning. For instance, summarizing a legal document often requires understanding concepts introduced early on and connecting them to later clauses. Transformers handle this well, as their architecture allows them to attend to and relate information across the entire document, regardless of length.  \\nNow that we are familiar with what the transformer model is, let’s dive into its architecture to see how it works!'),\n",

With its own self-attention mechanism, the decoder can also focus on previously generated tokens. This helps it align outputs with relevant input tokens during generation.

This masking prevents “cheating,” enforcing an autoregressive, left-to-right generation where each token can only reference previous ones. Additionally, the output embeddings are offset by one position to ensure the decoder generates each token based solely on prior outputs.  \\nFor example, during training, if the target output sequence is  \\nY=[y1,y2,y3,…,yn],  \\nthe decoder’s input is offset to  \\n[<start>,y1,y2,…,yn−1].  \\nThis offset guarantees that when predicting yi\\u200b, the decoder can only see tokens up to yi−1\\u200b, aligning with autoregressive sequence generation. For instance, while generating y3, the decoder only accesses [<start>,y1,y2] not y3\\u200b or any subsequent tokens like y4 or y5  \\nThis offset mechanism helps in training consistency by making the learning conditions match inference conditions, where tokens are generated sequentially without future context.

The position pos is divided by a scaling factor 10000^(2i/dmodel), where i is the dimension index and dmodel is the total number of dimensions.  \\nFor lower dimensions (small i), the scaling factor is smaller, which means the sine and cosine functions oscillate more slowly.
